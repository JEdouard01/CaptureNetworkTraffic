<h1>Packet Capture and Analyzer</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
As a security analyst, itâ€™s important to know how to capture and filter network traffic in a Linux environment. It is also vital to know the basic concepts associated with network interfaces. As such, this project consists of performing tasks associated with using tcpdump to capture network traffic by capturing the data in a packet capture (p-cap) file and then examining the contents of the captured packet data to focus on specific types of traffic.

<h2>PASTA</h2>
The Process of Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA) is a risk-centric threat modeling process developed by two OWASP leaders and supported by a cybersecurity firm called VerSprite. It focuses primarily on discovering evidence of viable threats and representing this information as a model. The evidence-based design of PASTA can be applied when threat modeling an application or the environment that supports that application. Its seven-stage process consists of various activities that incorporate relevant security artifacts of the environment, like vulnerability assessment reports.

<h2>Stage I: Define business and security objectives</h2>
A shopping application like this will need to process payments. Based on this description, we know certain technologies are required to keep information private and secure and that everything will need to be compliant with PCI-DSS. Accordingly, the DevSecOps team will have the analyze the following requirements: 

- <b>Users can create member profiles internally or by
connecting external accounts.</b>
- <b>The app must process financial transactions.</b>
- <b>The app should be in compliance with PCI-DSS.</b>

<h2>Stage II: Define the technical scope</h2>

<h2>Stage III: Decompose the application</h2>

<h2>Stage IV: Threat analysis</h2>

<h2>Stage V: Vulnerability analysis</h2>

<h2>Stage VI: Attack modeling</h2>

<h2>Stage VII: Risk analysis and impact</h2>
