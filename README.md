<h1>Packet Capture and Analyzer</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
As a security or network analyst, itâ€™s important to know how to capture and filter network traffic in a Linux environment. It is also vital to know the basic concepts associated with network interfaces. As such, this project consists of performing tasks associated with using tcpdump to capture network traffic from a Linux virtual machine by capturing the data in a packet capture (p-cap) file and then examining the contents of the captured packet data to focus on specific types of traffic.

<br />

<h2>Task 1. Identify network interfaces</h2>

In this task, network analyst must identify the network interfaces that can be used to capture network packet data by using the command "sudo tcpdump -D"(can also use "sudo ifconfig") to identify the interfaces that are available.

This command returns output similar to the following: <br/>

The Ethernet network interface is identified by the entry with the "eth" prefix.

<h2>Stage I: Define business and security objectives</h2>
A shopping application like this will need to process payments. Based on this description, we know certain technologies are required to keep information private and secure and that everything will need to be compliant with PCI-DSS. Accordingly, the DevSecOps team will have the analyze the following requirements: 

- <b>Users can create member profiles internally or by
connecting external accounts.</b>
- <b>The app must process financial transactions.</b>
- <b>The app should be in compliance with PCI-DSS.</b>

<h2>Stage II: Define the technical scope</h2>

<h2>Stage III: Decompose the application</h2>

<h2>Stage IV: Threat analysis</h2>

<h2>Stage V: Vulnerability analysis</h2>

<h2>Stage VI: Attack modeling</h2>

<h2>Stage VII: Risk analysis and impact</h2>
